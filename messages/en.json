    "manifestoText": "We are bastards, we go against the grain. Free thinking: be whatever you want to be, do whatever you want to do. Without fears, without prejudices. Being a bastard is having your own rules and breaking them whenever necessary. Every victory a new binge – and every defeat an even bigger one. We always move forward with a full glass in hand and thirst in our eyes. We leave behind what is not essential. In our luggage, a jacket for cold days. Strength and courage for hot days. Courage to go further, no matter where the road takes us. We found our identity. We know who we are and what we came for.",

A challenging project that came to change the lives of three entrepreneurs who left behind fears and stability to venture into the craft beer market. And today, being a bastard goes beyond beer, it became a lifestyle.",
